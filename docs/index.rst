Generating quivers
==================

Here are some functions that help generate quivers to test examples.

.. autofunction:: quivercombinatorics.quiver_from_cartan_matrix
.. autofunction:: quivercombinatorics.random_quiver

We notate quivers by :math:`Q`, with vertices in :math:`Q_0` and edges in :math:`Q_1`.

Constructing :math:`\Sigma_{\lambda}`
=====================================

We follow William Crawley-Boevey in `this paper <https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1017558904030>`__. Given a quiver :math:`Q` with :math:`n` vertices, and :math:`{\lambda}\in\mathbb{Z}^n`, :math:`\Sigma_{\lambda}` is the set of :math:`\alpha\in\mathbb{N}^n` such that :math:`\alpha` is a positive root of :math:`Q`, :math:`\alpha\cdot\lambda = 0`, and

.. math::

   p(\alpha)>\sum_{t=1}^r p(\beta^{(t)})

for any decomposition :math:`\alpha=\beta^{(1)}+\dots+\beta^{(r)}` with :math:`r\geq 2` and :math:`\beta^{(t)}` a positive root of :math:`Q` with :math:`\lambda\cdot\beta^{(t)}=0` for all `t`. 

.. automethod:: quivercombinatorics.quivercombinatorics.Quiver.p_function

We write :math:`R_\lambda^+` to denote the set of positive roots :math:`\alpha` with :math:`\alpha\cdot\lambda=0` and :math:`\mathbb{N}R_\lambda^+` for the set of sums of elements of :math:`R_\lambda^+`. Using `Theorem 5.6 of Crawley-Boevey's paper <https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1017558904030>`_.

.. admonition:: Theorem (Crawley-Boevey, 2001)

   For :math:`\alpha\in\mathbb{N}^n`, then :math:`\alpha\in\Sigma_\lambda` if and only if :math:`0\neq\alpha\in\mathbb{N}R_\lambda^+` and :math:`(\beta,\alpha-\beta)\leq -2` whenever :math:`\beta\in\mathbb{N}^n` and :math:`0<\alpha<\beta`.

.. automethod:: quivercombinatorics.quivercombinatorics.Quiver.R_lambda_plus

We also need the helper function ``N_set``.

.. autofunction:: quivercombinatorics.N_set

With these functions, we can define :math:`\Sigma_{\lambda}`.

.. automethod:: quivercombinatorics.quivercombinatorics.Quiver.sigma_lambda

CB-decompositions
==================

A *representation type* of :math:`x` of a quiver :math:`Q` is a sequence :math:`\tau=(\beta^{(1)},n_1;\dots;\beta^{(k)},n_k)` with :math:`\beta^{(i)}\in\Sigma_\lambda` and :math:`n_i\in\mathbb{N}` such that

.. math::

   x=\sum_{i=1}^k n_i\beta^{(i)}

We allow :math:`\beta^{(i)}` to occur multiple times if it is an imaginary root, i.e. :math:`p(\beta^{(i)})>0`. The *CB-decomposition* of :math:`x` is defined to be the unique representation type of :math:`x` for which

.. math::

   p(\tau):=\sum_{i=1}^k p(\beta^{(i)})

is maximal. In order to construct CB-decompositions (called canonical decompositions in `this paper <https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1017558904030>`__, but are *not* the same as ``canonical_decomposition`` from `QuiverTools`). We first need to find all representation types of :math:`x`, up to a bound :math:`v`, for which we need the following helper functions.

.. autofunction:: quivercombinatorics.vector_decomposition

.. autofunction:: quivercombinatorics.small_decomposition

With these functions, we can determine all representation types.

.. automethod:: quivercombinatorics.quivercombinatorics.Quiver.all_representation_types

Representation types of :math:`x` correspond to a symplectic leaf of the quiver variety :math:`M_0(Q,x)`, and the symplectic leaf dimension is :math:`2p` applied to the representation type, where :math:`p` is the ``p_function``.

.. automethod:: quivercombinatorics.quivercombinatorics.Quiver.symplectic_leaf_dimension

.. automethod:: quivercombinatorics.quivercombinatorics.Quiver.CB_decomposition

Knowing the CB-decomposition, it is then easy to calculate the dimension of the quiver variety :math:`M_0(Q,x)`, as it gives the largest (open) symplectic leaf inside :math:`M_0(Q,x)`.

.. automethod:: quivercombinatorics.quivercombinatorics.Quiver.quiver_variety_dimension

It's often important to know the codimension 2 leaves of the quiver variety :math:`M_0(Q,x)`, so we code this here.

.. automethod:: quivercombinatorics.quivercombinatorics.Quiver.codimension_two_leaves

:math:`\mathrm{ext}`-quivers
============================

Let :math:`\tau=(\beta^{(1)},n_1;\dots;\beta^{(k)},n_k)` be a representation type of :math:`Q`. The :math:`\mathrm{ext}`\ *-quiver* :math:`\tilde{Q}` associated to the symplectic leaf is the quiver with :math:`k` vertices where the number of edges between vertex :math:`i` and vertex :math:`j` is :math:`-(\beta^{(i)},\beta^{(j)})` and the number of loops at vertex :math:`i` is :math:`p(\beta^{(i)})`. The corresponding dimension vector of :math:`\tilde{Q}` is :math:`\mathbf{n}=(n_1,\dots,n_k)`, and we take :math:`\tilde{\lambda}=0`.

.. automethod:: quivercombinatorics.quivercombinatorics.Quiver.ext_quiver

.. autofunction:: quivercombinatorics.ext_dimension_vector

Classification of minimal degenerations of symplectic leaves
============================================================

For a quiver :math:`Q`, a positive root :math:`\alpha` is *minimal imaginary* if it is imaginary and given any positive root :math:`\beta`, :math:`\alpha>\beta` implies :math:`\beta` is real.

.. automethod:: quivercombinatorics.quivercombinatorics.Quiver.is_minimal_imaginary_root

.. automethod:: quivercombinatorics.quivercombinatorics.Quiver.all_minimal_imaginary_positive_roots

Given a quiver :math:`Q`, a *subquiver* :math:`T = (T_0, T_1)` is specified by a subset :math:`T_0\subset Q_0` of the vertices. Then, for :math:`i, j \in T_0 \subset Q_0` the number of edges between vertex :math:`i` and :math:`j` in :math:`T` equals the number of edges between vertex :math:`i` and :math:`j` in :math:`Q`. In particular, if :math:`i\in T_0` then the number of loops at :math:`i` in :math:`T` is the same as the number of loops at :math:`i` in :math:`Q`. The support of a dimension vector :math:`v` is the subset :math:`T_0 \subset Q_0` of all vertices :math:`i` such that :math:`v_i\neq 0`. We think of the support of :math:`v` as a subquiver of :math:`Q`.

We say that the subquiver :math:`T` is of *affine ADE type* if it is one of the graphs appearing in the classification of simply-laced affine Dynkin diagrams :math:`\tilde{A}_l`, :math:`\tilde{D}_l` or :math:`\tilde{E}_6`, :math:`\tilde{E}_7`, :math:`\tilde{E}_8`. Then there is a unique imaginary root :math:`\delta`, with :math:`p(\delta)=1`, whose support is :math:`T`. The key result is the classification of minimal imaginary roots is the following (Bellamy-Schedler 2026).

.. admonition:: Theorem (Bellamy-Schedler, 2026)

      If :math:`M` is a closed leaf in :math:`M_0(Q,x)` and :math:`M\subset\bar{L}` is a minimal degeneration, then :math:`\bar{L}\cong M\times S`, where :math:`S` is isomorphic to one of the following isolated singularities:

      1. A Kleinian singularity :math:`(\mathbb{C}^2/\Gamma, 0)`.

      2. The type A minimal nilpotent orbit closure :math:`(\mathcal{O}_{\min},0)` in :math:`\mathfrak{sl}_r(\mathbb{C})`.

      3. :math:`(\mathbb{C}^{2g}/\mathbb{Z}_2,0)`.

      4. :math:`\operatorname{Spec}(\mathbb{C}[x\mid\deg x\geq 2])`.

We define :math:`\tilde{\tau}(\beta,n):=(\beta,n;e_1,\alpha_1-n\beta_1;\dots;e_r,\alpha_r-n\beta_r)`. In each of the above cases, the leaf :math:`L` from this theorem corresponds to representation types:

   1. :math:`\tilde{\tau}(\delta,n)` for :math:`\delta` a minimal imaginary root on an affine ADE subquiver.

   2. :math:`\tilde{\tau}((1,1),n)` for a two-vertex subquiver with :math:`t\geq 3` edges between the vertices and no loops at the vertices.

   3. :math:`\tau=(e_i,a;e_i,a;e_1,\alpha_1;\dots;e_{i-1},\alpha_{i-1};e_{i+1},\alpha_{i+1};\dots)` where :math:`i` is a vertex with :math:`g\geq 1` loops and :math:`2a=\alpha_i`.

   4. :math:`\tau=(e_i,a;e_i,b;e_1,\alpha_1;\dots;e_{i-1},\alpha_{i-1};e_{i+1},\alpha_{i+1};\dots)` where :math:`i` is a vertex with :math:`g\geq 1` loops and :math:`0<a\neq b<\alpha_i` with :math:`a+b=\alpha_i`.

We assign the following labels to each subminimal representation type (i.e., representation types corresponding to a minimal degeneration):

   1. :math:`A_l,D_l` or :math:`E_6,E_7,E_8` for affine Dynkin diagram of type :math:`\tilde{A}_l,\tilde{D}_l` or :math:`\tilde{E}_6,\tilde{E}_7,\tilde{E}_8`.

   2. :math:`a_{r-1}`.

   3. :math:`c_g`.

   4. :math:`m_g`.

Plotting symplectic leaves in Hasse diagrams
============================================

We visualize the poset of symplectic leaves (equivalently of representation types) as a Hasse diagram: The vertices in this diagram are the representation types and the minimal degenerations, represented by an edge connecting two representation types, correspond to the situation where :math:`L_1\leq L_2` (equivalently, :math:`\tau_1\leq\tau_2`) but there does not exist :math:`L_3` such that :math:`L_1 < L_3 < L_2`. We wish to compute the Hasse diagram, for which there are two methods.

.. admonition:: Method 1

   Traverse the Hasse diagram from the bottom, starting with the lowest leaves. When we reach a leaf :math:`L_i`, we compute the :math:`\mathrm{ext}`-quiver associated to :math:`L_i`. On this :math:`\mathrm{ext}`-quiver, we compute subminimal representation types of :math:`\mathbf{n}`. For each such representation type :math:`\tilde{\tau}=(\gamma^{(1)},m_1;\dots;\gamma^{(r)},m_r)`, define:

   .. math::

      D(\tilde{\tau}):=\left(D(\gamma^{(1)}),m_1;\dots;D(\gamma^{(r)}),m_r\right)

   By (Bellamy-Schedler 2026), it is known that :math:`D(\tilde{\tau})` is a representation type for :math:`v`.

   In this way, we have a rule that assigns to each subminimal representation type of :math:`\tilde{Q}` a representation type :math:`D(\tilde{\tau}(\alpha))` of :math:`v`. It is known that :math:`\tau < D(\tilde{\tau}(\alpha))` is a minimal degeneration and they all occur in this way. Proceeding in this way allows one to build the Hasse diagram from the bottom up.

.. autofunction:: quivercombinatorics.D_map

.. autofunction:: quivercombinatorics.D_map_on_rep

.. automethod:: quivercombinatorics.quivercombinatorics.Quiver.minimal_degenerations

.. automethod:: quivercombinatorics.quivercombinatorics.Quiver.get_Hasse_diagram_method_1
   
.. automethod:: quivercombinatorics.quivercombinatorics.Quiver.plot_Hasse_diagram_method_1

To export this Hasse diagram as a TikZ diagram, we need to install ``dot2tex`` and ``graphviz``.

.. code-block::

   sage --pip install dot2tex
   sage --pip install graphviz

and then make sure you import the following

.. code-block::

   from sage.all import latex

.. automethod:: quivercombinatorics.quivercombinatorics.Quiver.plot_Hasse_diagram_method_1_labels

The example above should export the following diagram:

.. image:: poset_diagram.png
   :alt: Poset diagram

The second method to compute this Hasse diagram is as follows.

.. admonition:: Method 2

   Consider the larger set :math:`\mathcal{D}` of all decompositions of a given dimension vector :math:`v`. Here, a decomposition is simply a way of writing :math:`v` as a sum of smaller dimension vectors with multiplicities:

   .. math::
   
      \left(n_1,\beta^{(1)};\dots;n_k,\beta^{(k)}\right),
   
   where the :math:`\beta^{(i)}` are dimension vectors satisfying :math:`\beta^{(i)}\leq v`. Following `this paper <http://matrix.uantwerpen.be/lieven.lebruyn/b2hd-LeBruyn1988b.html>`__, we say that:

   .. math::
   
      \varepsilon=(p_1,\gamma^{(1)};\dots;p_l,\gamma^{(l)})>\rho=(m_1,\alpha^{(1)};\dots;m_r,\alpha^{(r)})
   
   is a *direct successor* (:math:`\varepsilon` is the successor of :math:`\rho`) if either:

      1. :math:`l=r+1` and :math:`\varepsilon` can be ordered such that for all :math:`1\leq i\leq r-1` we have :math:`(m_i,\alpha^{(i)})=(p_i,\gamma^{(i)})` and :math:`m_r=p_r=p_{r+1},\gamma^{(r)}+\gamma^{(r+1)}=\alpha^{(r)}`.

      2. :math:`l=r-1` and :math:`\varepsilon` can be ordered such that for all :math:`1\leq i\leq r-2` we have :math:`(m_i,\alpha^{(i)})=(p_i,\gamma^{(i)})` and :math:`\alpha^{(r)}=\alpha^{(r-1)}=\gamma^{(r-1)},m_{r-1}+m_r=p_{r-1}`.

The symplectic leaves form a subset of this set of decompositions, and by restriction, they inherit a sub-poset structure. It is shown in (Bellamy-Schedler, 2026) that this is the partial ordering given by leaf closure.

.. automethod:: quivercombinatorics.quivercombinatorics.Quiver.all_decompositions

.. autofunction:: quivercombinatorics.is_direct_successor

.. automethod:: quivercombinatorics.quivercombinatorics.Quiver.get_Hasse_diagram_method_2

.. automethod:: quivercombinatorics.quivercombinatorics.Quiver.plot_Hasse_diagram_method_2

It seems that Method 2 is slower than Method 1, so we only implemented a TikZ exporter for Method 1.

   Future directions
..
   ==================
..
      1. We could compute the hyperplane arrangement on which the Namikawa-Weyl group acts.
..
      2. We could rewrite this code in *Julia*, which is apparently more performant than SageMath in some instances. We can use that *QuiverTools* has a *Julia* implementation.
